    summary: |
      I am a 3rd-year master student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) advised by Prof. Ke Zhou 
      and a member of Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics (WNLO). I am broadly interested in distributed file/storage systems
      including object storage, cloud storage, and NoSQL. My recent research projects include query optimization of storage systems
      by using deep learning algorithms and graph mining with hashing. Prior to HUST, I received the Bachelor degree in
      Computer Science and Technology from Huazhong Agricultural University in 2016.

    assignments:
      - title: SwiftGraph: a middleware for enabling accurate and fast semantic queries in storage systems through deep learning
        link: "#hook"
        tagline: "Existing storage systems with simple metadata and conventional hierarchical directory tree fail to meet the requirement of content-based query operations like finding semantically similar images with a specific image file. Therefore, we design and implement SwiftGraph which is a system middle that supports semantic metadata generated from deep learning hash. SwiftGraph applies a high-performance graph structure to organize the semantic hash codes and therefore provides low-latency content-based query interfaces. The performance evaluation on the different datasets demonstrates the query accuracy, and efficiency outruns other metadata search paradigms."

      - title: Semantic Hash Rank of Graphs for Lightening and Assessing Image "Dark Data"
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Dark data are some existing data that the developers or the users are not aware of their existence or value, or do not know about how to extract value from them. To address the emerging dark data challenge, we propose a framework for lightening the image dark data by using semantic hash ranking (SHR) algorithm. This framework can also score the image dark data. Therefore it helps find “important images” in the massive dataset. The evaluation results demonstrate the performance and validity of our method."

      - title: Disk Failure Prediction in Tencent Cloud via Machine Learning (Internship at Tencent)
        link: "#"
        tagline: "According to the survey from MicroSoft Research, disk failures account for a majority (78%) of replacements/faults in datacenters. In this project, we built an infrastructure for collecting the long-term S.M.R.A.T. data from HDDs of ten thousand servers from Tencent data centers and monitoring disk health in real time. The historical disk failures data constitute positive samples for predicting faults of disks. We use several machine learning algorithms to train the prediction model. Our experiments indicate that our model can achieve both high precision and high recall."

      - title: Web Service Recommendation Using Bayesian Network Reasoning
        link: "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-94376-3_2"
        tagline: "It is important to recommend the atomic service and a set of services with correlations for meeting users’ QoS requirements in the era of service-oriented computing. To effectively organize and recommend web services, we make use of three-stage Bayesian network structure learning to construct a directed acyclic graph (network) and parameter learning to learn the conditional probability of all the nodes of the network. Compared with other service recommendation methods, the Bayesian network is more suitable for correlated services. Considerable experiments are conducted to validate and illustrate the proposed methods. "

      - title: Automatic Measurement of Character Parameters of the Rapeseed Plant via Image Lines Detection
        link: "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7248122/?arnumber=7248122"
        tagline: "Character parameters of crops like plant height and length of the branch are of great importance to production and mechanized harvest. We propose a methodology for measuring the character parameters of rapeseed plants automatically by detecting line segments in the plant images. The image line detection process utilizes a Line Segment Detector (PAMI 2010) which is a fast, accurate and state-of-the-art algorithm. For eliminating the useless and short line segments, we use a number of techniques based on the geometric features of extracted lines. The experiment shows that the error rate (around 1.25%) of the results is quite low with inexpensive computing resources, which can better meet the actual demands of agriculture."
